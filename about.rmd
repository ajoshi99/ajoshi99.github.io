I am a research Biostatistician at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in the [Department of Environmental Medicine and Public Health](https://icahn.mssm.edu/about/departments/environmental-public-health). I primarily work with [Dr. Megan Niedzwiecki](https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/megan-m-niedzwiecki) on studying the effects of environmental exposures by studying the metabolomic profiles of pregnant women and children. 

My resume is available [here]("AnuJoshi_CV.pdf").
